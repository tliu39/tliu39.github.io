            <p class="h2">I am a Computational Applied Mathematics master student in the
                    <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a>. Previously, I received my BS in Computer Science from the
                    <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>.

                I am broadly interested in machine learning, numerical analysis, quantitative biology, computer vision and natural language processing.

                I will be joining
                    <a href="https://www.ebchinatech.com/">Everbright Technology (光大科技)</a>
                as a Data Scientist after graduation.

                For non-Chinese speakers, Everbright Technology is a subsidy of the
                    <a href="https://www.ebchinaintl.com/en/global/home.php">Everbright Group</a>

            <h3>A Survey on Basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics">Population Genetics</a> Models</h3>
                <img src="Fixation_Extinction_Time_without_Fitness.png" class="h3" width="50%">
                <p class="h3">This is a survey on several population genetics models, including the Wright-Fisher model, Neutral Moran Model and Biased Moran Model.
                    It specifically focus on the fixation time and extinction time of the original allele and its mutant type.

            <h3>A Study on Epidemic Spreading Models</h3>
                <img src="p4_yule.png" class="h3" width="50%">
                <p class="h3">This is a study on several epidemic spreading models, including the branching process model, the suspect-infected-recovered model and the Yule process model.
                    The average outbreak size of those models are extensively studied in this writeup.
                    Those models are also applicable in bacterial growth.

            <h3>Predicting Housing Prices</h3>
            <p class="h3">Several regression models are proposed to sale price of the houses in a US city.
                This is based on slightly less than 2000 samples.
                About 1600 samples are in the training dataset, and the testing dataset contains 350 samples.
                A testing rmse of around $21000 has been achieved by the final model.
                The full project is available on the <a href="https://github.com/tliu39/predicting_house_sale_price.git">Github</a>.
